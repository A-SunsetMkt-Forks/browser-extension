# Privacy Policy

### FoxyProxy extension

FoxyProxy extension is free and open source software. We care about user privacy, and we do not collect or share any user data. We do not advertise. We do not use web beacons, analytics software, cookies, or any other tracking methods. All user data usages are listed below and the [source code](https://github.com/foxyproxy/browser-extension) is available to examine for verification.

### Your Personal Information

FoxyProxy extension does not collect any personal identifiable information (PII), visited sites, traffic, or any other usage.
All user-entered data (such as proxy server IP addresses) are stored locally in the browser and not logged or sent anywhere else.
Once the extension is uninstalled, all data is deleted by the browser.


### Authentication Data

User-entered authentication data (proxy username & passwords) are sent only to the proxy servers the user has selected.

### Sync

FoxyProxy extension allows you to synchronize options across devices. Syncing is optional and disabled by default. If enabled, transfer of your data is processed and handled by the browser and not by FoxyProxy. Data is sent by the browser from one FoxyProxy instance to the others.

### Log

Log page displays the network connection details as it happens (live). Data displayed on this page is not stored or sent anywhere and is gone once the log page is closed or refreshed.

### Proxies: Get Location

The optional 'Get Location' button is an extra feature to get the geolocation of proxy servers. It is only invoked if the user decides to use this feature. Proxy hostnames are sent to `getfoxyproxy.org` to get country and city information. That info is populated in the extension. No other data is sent or stored.

### Toolbar Popup: IP

The optional 'IP' button on the toolbar popup is an extra feature which sends a request to the `getfoxyproxy.org` to display the current location of the network connection. It is often used to test that proxy servers are responding. No other data is sent or stored. It is only invoked if the user decides to use this feature.

### Toolbar Popup: Location

The optional 'Location' button opens `getfoxyproxy.org/geoip/`in a new tab, which shows the status of the current network connection. Additionally, it can show if the real IP leaks via WebRTC. No other data is sent or stored. It is only invoked if the user decides to use this feature
